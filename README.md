# ulteammate-profile-generator-10



## Description 

An app that produces artwork and drink ingredients at random for the user. The drink display works by receiving a user's input (the type of alcohol they desire to use) and fetching a random drink's name and ingredients, 
                with instructions for putting it together. The other aspect of the app is simply a generator of random art images from the Metropolitan Museum in New York. If the user desires a new drink or artwork result, they can simply re-click the respective button to receive new content.
                The purpose of this app is to provide users with an entertainment tool that can be enjoyed by groups of people, especially during periods of physical isolation like the Covid-19 quarantine

## Tests
 the basic test to run is to determine whether each button-click will produce new content. As out current MVP runs, it does respond to each button click with new drink information and artwork; however there is a slight buffer thay might cause problems for the user.
